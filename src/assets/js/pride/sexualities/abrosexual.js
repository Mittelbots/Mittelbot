        "Abrosexual people experience their sexual orientation as fluid and/or changing over time. Although other kinds of fluidity may involve changes in the genders someone is attracted to, abrosexuality involves someone's entire orientation changing over time. The intensity of their attractions may change as well. There is no set schedule experienced by all abrosexual people; it may fluctuate between hours, days, weeks, months, or even years for their orientations to change. Some abrosexual individuals do have their own fixed patterns or schedules, but not all. Some may be fluid between a few orientations, while others are fluid between several. Because abrosexual people can sometimes be asexual, abrosexuality can fall under the asexual spectrum. It also falls under the multisexuality umbrella, which includes people who are romantically or sexuality attracted to multiple genders.",
