        "Pangender is a gender identity defined as experiencing many or all genders. As an identity that is multigender—experiencing or having multiple genders—the number of genders experienced may be unknown or may fluctuate, and they may be experienced one at a time or simultaneously. Pangender encompasses so many genders that is difficult or impossible to list all of them, and can be described as experiencing an immense number of genders. Pangender can also be defined as a multigender which is expansive, nonspecific, vast, and infinite, while still extending only to one's own culture and life experience. There is no limit to the amount of genders a pangender person can have. This identity can go beyond the current knowledge of genders, identifying infinitely with gender, including the hypothetical.",
