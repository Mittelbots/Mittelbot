    description:
        'Genderfuck, also known as genderpunk,[source?] can describe a gender identity and/or gender expression where gendered expectations are deliberately played with to combine gender-specific signals. The act of engaging in this identity or expression is sometimes referred to as genderfucking. Individuals who genderfuck are sometimes referred to as genderfucks or genderfuckers. Genderfuck people are considered under the umbrella terms gender non-conforming and transgender, but not all identify with those terms. Some genderfuck people transition socially, physically, and/or legally. Individual drag performers may or may not additionally identify as genderfucks. In the 2020 Gender Census, 42 people described their identity as "genderfuck," 17 described their identity as "genderpunk," 11 described their identity as "genderfucked," and 3 described their identity as "genderfucker."',
