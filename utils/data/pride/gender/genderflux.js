        "Genderflux refers to a person whose experience with their gender identity changes in intensity. A genderflux person's connection to gender may weaken or strengthen at random. For example, an individual could be a man most of the time, but then other times that connection to their gender could feel weaker, or even completely disappear. Genderflux could thus be compared to a thermometer, which can show fluctuating temperatures over time.",
