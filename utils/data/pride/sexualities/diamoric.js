    description: `Diamoric—also known as adonian, adonic, cypric, or dionysian — is generally considered an umbrella term referring to the attractions experienced by non-binary individuals that cannot be described as "same gender" or "other gender", "straight" or "gay". As an identity word for non-binary people, it can be used to describe their sexual or romantic orientations, rather than being a specific orientation term of its own, or used to describe their relationships. Some non-binary people use it to emphasize their own gender identity and their attractions or relationships with other non-binary people. For instance, someone who is genderfluid and bisexual might describe themselves as a diamoric bisexual. Diamoric can also describe relationships in which one or more of the partners is non-binary, including relationships where one of the members is binary.`,
